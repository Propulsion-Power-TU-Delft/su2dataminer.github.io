SU2 DataMiner
=============

SU2 DataMiner is an open-source, python-based software library for data-driven fluid modeling applications in `SU2`_. 
The software currently supports laminar combustion and real-gas applications where the thermodynamic state of the fluid is evaluated by deep, dense, feed-forward multi-layer perceptrons trained 
using physics-informed machine learning methods.
